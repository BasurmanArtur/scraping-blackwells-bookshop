# Scraping Blackwell's Bookshop

## Goal
In this project, I showed how to apply your Python knowledge in real-world situations. For this purpose, I collected the metadata of more than 11000 books from the Blackwell's bookshop [website](https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/home).

## Data
The collected data is divided into two `csv` files:
1. `blackwell_shop_raw.csv` contains raw data before data cleaning
2. `blackwell_shop_cleaned.csv` contains cleaned data (for example, some string values were transformed into numeric values)

## Installation 
You can install all the necessary libraries to run the project by running:

```conda create --name <env_name> --file requirements.txt```

if using `conda`

or

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

if using `pip`.
